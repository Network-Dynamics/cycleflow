*  How loopiness affects scaling of perturbation
     Tree:
        1. Edge perturbation: constant
        2. Node perturbation: -d


     Cycle graph:
        1. Edge perturbation: constant
	2. Node perturbation: -d


     Grid graph (2d):
        1. Edge perturbation: 1/d
	2. Node perturbation: -ln(d)

     Grid graph (3d):
        1. Edge perturbation: 1/d^2
	2. Node perturbation: 1/d


 Maybe related to 
 	- diameter/size
	- E-V+1 (loopiness)

             
*  It's all connected to the meta graph resistances
     1.  What if the meta graph has negative weights?

*  Analytical computation of scaling: trigonal graphs?
