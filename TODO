*  How loopiness affects scaling of perturbation
     Tree:
        1. Edge perturbation: constant
        2. Node perturbation: scale as -d

     Cycle graph:
        1. Edge perturbation: 1/d**2
	2. Node perturbation: 1/d

     Grid graph:
        1. Edge perturbation: 1/d
	2. Node perturbation: -ln(d)
	             
*  It's all connected to the meta graph resistances
     1.  What if the meta graph has negative weights?

*  Analytical computation of scaling: trigonal graphs?
